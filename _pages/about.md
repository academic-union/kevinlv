## About me: 


I am a third-year master in ECE at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Tianjin University. Before that, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degrees from Tianjin University in 2022. I am fortunate to collaborate with researchers of   <span style="color:#004080"> Georgia Tech, HKUST, University of Macau and Tianjin University.  </span>




I am currently or potentially interested in the following topics:

* **Domain-specific accelerator**: How to design task-oriented hardware accelerators, specifically focusing on real-time data handling and low-power performance?
* **Software and Hardware co-design**: How to integrate software and hardware to achieve task-specific accelerators?
* **Image coding for machine vision tasks**: How can we develop deep learned image compression techniques that effectively support a range of downstream vision tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection?

I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions for Fall 2025. If you have or know of any opportunities that align with my interests, I would be grateful if you could contact me at ylyu72@gatech.edu. I am very interested in discussing any potential opportunities. Thank you!
