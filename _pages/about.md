## About me: 

I am a third-year master in ECE at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Tianjin University. Before that, I earned my bachelor’s degrees from Tianjin University in 2022. I am fortunate to collaborate with researchers of Georgia Tech, HKUST, University of Macau and Tianjin University. 

I am currently or potentially interested in the following topics:
* Domain-specific accelerator: How to design task-oriented hardware accelerators, specifically focusing on real-time data handling and low-power performance?
* Software and Hardware co-design: How to integrate software and hardware to achieve task-specific accelerators?
* Image coding for machine vision tasks: How can we develop deep learned image compression techniques that effectively support a range of downstream vision tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection?

I am actively seeking Ph.D. positions for Fall 2025. If you have or know of any opportunities that align with my interests, I would be grateful if you could contact me at ylyu72@gatech.edu. I am very interested in discussing any potential opportunities. Thank you!
